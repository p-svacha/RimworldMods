    <P42_TL_PhonosphereActivityGizmoDesc>The Phonosphere's disturbance level rises over time. Disturbance rises faster when outside or exposed to loud noises.\n\nThe higher the disturbance level, the worse sounds the sphere will emit periodically.\n\nWardens can reduce the spheres disturbance by playing instrument nearby. They will suppress it anytime its activity is above the assigned level: {0}</P42_TL_PhonosphereActivityGizmoDesc>
